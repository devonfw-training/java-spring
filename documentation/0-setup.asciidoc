= Setup

Install https://github.com/devonfw/ide[devonfw-ide]:

* Install https://git-scm.com/downloads[git] if not already installed (download and run installer)
* Create the folder `C:\Projects\devonfw-training` (if you do not have Windows, use `projects/devonfw-training` in root or if not permitted in home).
* Download `devonfw-ide-scripts` package from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here]
* Extract the contents of `devonfw-ide-scripts` package into the above created folder `devonfw-training`. The contents of the package shall be directly in the folder `devonfw-training` without any sub-folder such as `devonfw-ide-scripts`. If you have no idea how to do this, install https://www.7-zip.org/download.html[7-Zip] and use it to extract.
* Run the `setup` script (on Windows `setup.bat`) from `devonfw-training` folder.
* Enter this settings-URL: https://github.com/devonfw-training/java-spring-settings.git
* Read and confirm the terms-of-use.
* wait until the setup process has completed.

== Create Project

Now we create a new `devon4j` project:

* Go to folder `workspaces/main` in `devonfw-training`.
* In Windows-Explorer right-click it and select `Git Bash Here`.
* In your `workspaces/main` folder run this command:
+
```
devon java create org.example.app
```
* `cd app`
* `mvn clean install`

== Import into Eclipse

Next, we import the new `app` project into our Eclipse IDE:

* `devon eclipse`
* In Eclipse `Import` as `Existing Maven Project`, there click `Browse` and choose your generated `app` folder.
* Now select `SpringBootApp` from `app-core` and do `Run As` with option `Java Application`.
* Visit http://localhost:8081 in your browser
* Login as `admin` with same password (see `BaseWebSecurityConfig.configureGlobal`).
