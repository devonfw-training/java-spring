= Data Access Layer

In this chapter we are going to create the `dataaccess` layer of our app.
We create the entities and repositories as well as the corresponding database schema and initial data.

== Create Entities

After you have created your own link:0-setup.asciidoc[devon4j app creation], we are going to create our first app component.
In your `core` module create the package `org.example.app.ordermanagement.dataaccess.api` (in `src/main/java`).
Inside this package create the `ItemEntity` and `OrderEntity` as illustrated by the following diagramm:

image::images/Entities.png[width="100%"]

However, the `OrderStatus` Enum has to be created in the `api` module (because it is a datatype that will later be used in our API) in the package `org.example.app.ordermanagement.common.api`.

== Create Repositories

For each entity create a corresponding repository in the package `org.example.app.ordermanagement.dataaccess.api.repo`.

== Create DDL

Create flyway SQL files in `core/src/main/resources/db/migration/1.0` to define your https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Definition_Language[DDL] as following:

Create file `V0005__Create_Order.sql` with this content:
[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE RESTAURANT_ORDER (
  ID                  BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  MODIFICATIONCOUNTER INTEGER NOT NULL,
  PRICE               DECIMAL(5, 2) NOT NULL,
  CREATION_DATE       TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  PAYMENT_DATE        TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  STATUS              VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
----

Create file `V0006__Create_Item.sql` with this content:
[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE ITEM (
  ID                  BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  MODIFICATIONCOUNTER INTEGER NOT NULL,
  CREATION_DATE       TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  NAME                VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  PRICE               DECIMAL(5, 2) NOT NULL,
  ORDER_ID            BIGINT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (ID),
  FOREIGN KEY (ORDER_ID) REFERENCES RESTAURANT_ORDER(ID)
);
----

Please note that you can delete the `core/src/main/resources/db/type` subfolders except for `h2` if you like as we are just using H2 DB for simplicity.
In a real project you would use H2 DB only for testing (in JUnits and have flyway SQLs for `h2` in `core/src/test/resources/db/test/`) and use a real DB (SAP Hana, Oracle, etc.) for main usage.

You can check that your schema is valid running `SpringBootApp`.
Surely you will need to add some JPA annotations to make your entities work with this DDL.

== Create Test-data
We can easily provide test-data to our app so we do not have to test with an empty DB.
This can easily be done with another Flyway SQL script.
In a real project, we would create that in `core/src/test/resources/db/` but for simplicity to have it also when we start our app regular (not via JUnit), we simply also add it to `core/src/main/resources/db/migration/1.0`.
Create file `V0007__Insert_Testdata.sql` with this content:
[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO RESTAURANT_ORDER(ID, MODIFICATIONCOUNTER, CREATION_DATE, STATUS, PRICE) VALUES (1, 0, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'OPEN', 25.50);
INSERT INTO ITEM(ID, MODIFICATIONCOUNTER, CREATION_DATE, NAME, PRICE, ORDER_ID) VALUES (1, 0, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'Spaghetti Bolognese', 12.50, 1);
INSERT INTO ITEM(ID, MODIFICATIONCOUNTER, CREATION_DATE, NAME, PRICE, ORDER_ID) VALUES (2, 0, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'Red Wine: Capezzana, Conti Contini Sangiovese Toscana', 13.00, 1);
----

During the exercise you can extend this testdata SQL as you like.
Run application and check that the data you provided is inserted into the database.

== Create JUnits
Now you can create JUnit tests.
First, we fix our `app/core/pom.xml` by replacing `devon4j-test` dependency with this:
```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.devonfw.java.modules</groupId>
      <artifactId>devon4j-test-jpa</artifactId>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
```

Now, we can create simple JUnits for our repositories like this:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootTest(classes = SpringBootApp.class, webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.MOCK)
public class OrderRepositoryTest extends ComponentDbTest {

  @Inject
  private OrderRepository orderRepository;

  @Test
  public void testFindOrder() {

    // given
    Long orderId = Long.valueOf(1L);
    // when
    OrderEntity order = this.orderRepository.find(orderId);
    // then
    assertThat(order).isNotNull();
    assertThat(order.getPrice()).isEqualTo(new BigDecimal("25.50"));
    // ...
  }

}
----

== Setup H2-console
The H2-concole can be helpful for debugging issues with the data. It can be started with the server and accessed by a webbrowser. For this some changes in the code are necessary.

* Add the following dependencies to the `pom.xml` in the core package and then run `mvn clean install`:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hsqldb</groupId>
    <artifactId>hsqldb</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
----

* From config/application.properties in the core package copy the value of `spring.datasource.url` you find here, we will need it later. Also add in this file:
[source,txt]
----
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
----

* In the class `BaseWebSecurityConfig` add at the end of the method configure:
[source,java]
----
        // Fix for H2-console Frame Sets
        http.headers().frameOptions().sameOrigin();
----

* Now start your server and go to _http://localhost:8081/h2-console_. If this gives you an 403 or 404, you might have set a value for `server.servlet.context-path` in your `application.properties`. Than you have to put it in the URL as path prefix.
* You should now see a login screen for the H2-console. If you are asked to login in our app, just do it as usual, but afterwards you should be routed to the h2-console. In the login screen of the H2-console set the value of JDBC URL to the value of `spring.datasource.url` from before. Leave the user name as `sa` and the password empty.

== Extra assignment

Extend the OrderRepository with a search for orders by price (lower/greater) and state (equal). Theses values should be variable parameters, so a dynamic query is suggested. Add test data and test for the repositories.
